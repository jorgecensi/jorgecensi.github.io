I've been looking for reported experiences with remote work and I've ended up finding a website that contains some information about that.

Remote Only work promotes:

- 🌍 Hiring and working from all over the world instead of from a central location.
- ⚖️ Flexible working hours over set working hours.
- 🗒 Writing down and recording knowledge over oral explanations.
- 📝 Written down processes over on-the-job training.
- 📢 Public sharing of information over need-to-know access.
- 📖 Opening every document to change by anyone over top-down control of documents.
- 🔃 Asynchronous communication over synchronous communication.
- 🎯 The results of work over the hours put in.s
- 📜 Formal communication channels over informal communication channels.

While there is sometimes value in the items on the right, the items on the left are valued more.

There is <a href="https://lnkd.in/g-q-dgB">this</a> another article I like that explains it

What do you think about it?
