One thing we have to bear in mind is that as developers we have to keep studying all the time. As technologies evolve and some become obsolete we need to try staying up to date with what the market is in need of.

The developer roadmap is a GitHub repository where it contains a graphic representation of what is necessary and optional for a developer career. It's split into categories like Frontend, Backend, DevOps and so on.

I recommend you have a look at it so you can get an idea of what to study next. <a href="https://roadmap.sh/">https://roadmap.sh/</a>

Have good learning.
