Typing is a basic skill that is now one of the most important programming skills to master. Learning to type easily and correctly would support you in a number of scenarios, and it should be considered a required ability for everyone who plans to work with a computer in some way (which is almost everyone!).

Having that in mind, I found a nice website to practice typing. <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">https://www.typingclub.com/</a>
The good thing about this site is that you learn to type better by playing.
All lesson are engaging and interactive.
You also can see your stats and understand which key you need to improve speed and accuracy.

So go have a try and become a better typist.
