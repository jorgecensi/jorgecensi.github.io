Typing is a basic skill that is now one of the most important programming skills to master. Learning to type easily and correctly would support you in a number of scenarios, and it could be considered a required ability for everyone who plans to work with a computer in some way (which is almost everyone!).

<a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">https://www.typingclub.com/</a> is a website where you can learn and practice touch typing.
The good thing about this site is that you learn to type better by playing.
All lesson are engaging and interactive.
