I've been looking for reported experiences with remote work and I've ended up with this website (https://remoteonly.org)that contains some information about that. 

Remote Only work promotes:

- Hiring and working from all over the world instead of from a central location.

- Flexible working hours over set working hours.

- Writing down and recording knowledge over oral explanations.

- Written down processes over on-the-job training.

-Public sharing of information over need-to-know access.

- Opening every document to change by anyone over top-down control of documents.

- Asynchronous communication over synchronous communication.

- The results of work over the hours put in.

- Formal communication channels over informal communication channels.

While there is sometimes value in the items on the right, we have come to value the items on the left more.

There is another article I like explaining that. https://lnkd.in/g-q-dgB


What do you think about it?
